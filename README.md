•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In this course, I learned that software engineers or developers use dynamic testing to uncover errors and bugs and ensure the program is running as expected. Specifically, we used a unit testing approach to test every part of our code based on the specifications. Our code was in Java, so we used the Junit5 framework.
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The interpretation of user needs and their incorporation into a program follow multiple steps depending on the models ( waterfall, V-model, iterative and incremental development). Users’ needs constitute the requirements specification of the program. They are identified during analysis through various methods such as interview, JAD, observation, and documentation (written procedures, business form, report ). The analysis phase continues with process modeling, which captures data flow using a data flow diagram or UML use case diagram. The analysis phase ends with data modeling using entity relationships where data are organized and ready to be used by the design phase. Once the design phase is completed, data and functions are used in the implementation phase, where engineers or developers code.
 How do I approach designing software?
The design phase is built upon the earlier phases, which means :
      	Understand the verification and validation of analysis models
      	Understand the transition from analysis to design
      	Understand the use of factoring, partition, collaborations, and layers
      	Be able to create package diagrams
 Specifically, the design phase encompasses class and method design, data management and layers design, human and computer interaction layer design, and finally, physical architecture layer design. A successful design should lead to a smooth implementation.
